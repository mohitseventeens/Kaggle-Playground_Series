# Stroke Prediction Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the code and resources for the Stroke Prediction Kaggle Competition. The goal of the competition is to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on various input features. Submissions are evaluated based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this competition contains information about patients, including demographic data, medical history, and lifestyle habits. The features include:

- id: unique identifier
- gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
- age: age of the patient
- hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
- heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
- ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
- work_type: "children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
- Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
- avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
- bmi: body mass index
- smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"
- stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
