# Stroke Prediction Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the code and resources for the Stroke Prediction Kaggle Competition. The goal of the competition is to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on various input features. Submissions are evaluated based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC).

## Overview

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Modeling
4. Model Evaluation and Selection
5. Hyperparameter Tuning

## Repository Structure

- `PS - S3E2, Stroke Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the project.
